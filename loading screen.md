1. Kuo-Toa are a nascent psionic race. The power of their sheer collective belief is enough to manifest magic. It is believed that their own imagination birthed Blibdoolpoolp, a paranoid, reality-denying deity of the sea known for questionable sanity.
2. The animosty of Kobolds vs Gnomes is ancient. Kobolds harbor a deep grudge ever since Kurtulmak was buried in a mountain as part of a "Prank." According to Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, kobolds enslaved gnomes and Garl Glittergold collapsed the mountain to free his people from kobold cruelty.
3. Across Faerun, there are a variety of classifications of "True Dragons" including Chromatic, Metallic, Ferrous, Planar, Gem, and Lung. There are also Air, Cobra, Deep, Fang, Force, Mist, Moon, Prismatic, Pyroclastic, Radiant, Rattelyr, Song, Sun, and Time dragons; and Brainstealers (horrible Illithid creations), Dzalmus, Vishaps, Hellfire wyrms, and the Abishai that serve Tiamat.
4. Yugoloths created barghests when Maglubiyet refused to pay for mercenaries. These shapeshifters hide among a tribe until it can devour the soul of Maglubiyet's favored goblins. Barghets owe their masters seventeen souls before escaping to Gehenna, one for every oath Maglubiyet broke.
5. Zariel was once a powerful angel, but her all-consuming focus to slay demons was her fall from grace. Zariel was betrayed and imprisoned and siphoned for power, before reclaiming her place as Archduchess of Avernus and the Lord of the First. Her story is one of humiliation, pain, suffering, imprisonment, cruelty, and paranoia. The only relief is the destruction of her enemy, the blood of demons, and winning the war.
6. Rumors suspect Yugoloths intentionally help both sides of the Blood War just enough to maintain the conflict in status quo. Soul gems are used to pay for their services, a more potent and valuable version of the Soul Coins you find scattered across your adventure.
7. "My legions are the only thing standing between your precious Seven Heavens and the bottomless hunger of the Abyss. I did not fall into the clutches of evil. I rose to shoulder a cosmic burden." - Zariel.
8. Drow and Gith societies are predicated on avoiding signs of weakness at any turn. From birth, they look over their shoulder lest their own mothers strangle them in the crib.
9. The original "Hell Riders" were the mounted cavalry guard of Elturel. Faced with infernal threats, Zariel appeared and offered to lead a cavalry charge into the hells themselves. In the battle, many riders broke ranks and escaped, and closed the exit behind them, trapping Zariel. Zariel swore revenge, and orchestrated Elturel's descent into Avernus.
10. The bitter disposition of Elturelian tieflings stem from their memory of a time before they became enslavement in Avernus, part of Zariel's cruel punishment for a betrayal that happened a generation before their time, and the subsequent bigotry faced when they returned to the Prime Material.
11. As a consequence of Karsus's Folly, the damage to the Weave was so great that Mystryl sacrified herself. Mystryl reincarnated as Mystra who, in repairing the weave, limited mortal access to magic to 9th level spells. She gives visions of the destruction of the Netherese to clerics and wizards who pray for her wisdom, and Karsus is memorialized as the enduring warning of what no mortal should ever attempt. Still, some - perhaps those you travel with - believe they could survive apotheosis.
12. Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm might sound, look, and act like a bumbling fool, but his disarming persona has allowed him to survive an audience with dragons, gods, and devils.
13. Volo's guide books are widely ridiculed across Faerun as being full of embellishment, bluster, lies, speculation, and nonsense; but buried at the heart of everything is a grain of truth.
14. Volo's fool act is so convincing, that Mystra made him a Weave Anchor. Not even Volo knows this. Mystra believes that even if this secret was discovered, no one from Asmodeus to Zariel would ever be able to take Volo seriously enough to believe it.
15. Elminster pretends that his job as Volo's editor is to prevent the spread of incorrect information. In reality, Volo sometimes - rarely - discovers something so powerful and dangerous that publishing it could threaten the very realms. Elminster subtly alters Volo's notes and intercepts manuscripts to obscure Volo's discoveries with injected nonsense.
