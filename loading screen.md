1. Kuo-Toa are a nascent psionic race. The power of their sheer collective belief is enough to manifest magic. It is believed that their own imagination birthed Blibdoolpoolp, a paranoid, reality-denying deity of the sea known for questionable sanity.
2. The animosty of Kobolds vs Gnomes is ancient. Some theorize that the two races naturally compete for similar habitats, and that is the source of their conflict; but kobolds harbor a deep grudge ever since their creator diety, Kurtulmak, was buried in a mountain as part of a "Prank." According to Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, kobolds enslaved gnomes and Garl Glittergold collapsed the mountain to free his people from kobold cruelty.
3. Across Faerun, there are a variety of classifications of "True Dragons" including Chromatic, Metallic, Ferrous, Planar, Gem, and Lung. There are also Air, Cobra, Deep, Fang, Force, Mist, Moon, Prismatic, Pyroclastic, Radiant, Rattelyr, Song, Sun, and Time dragons; and Brainstealers (horrible Illithid creations), Dzalmus, Vishaps, Hellfire wyrms, and the Abishai that serve Tiamat.
4. Long ago, Maglubiyet petitioned the General of Gehenna for yugoloth mercenaries but broke the deal after refusing to pay. In response, Gehenna created barghests, shapeshifting wolf-goblins which could hide among a tribe until it could devour the soul of Maglubiyet's favored. Supposedly, barghets owe their masters seventeen souls before escaping to Gehenna, one for every oath Maglubiyet broke.
5. Baatezu and Tanar'ri, or Demons and Devils in Common, are locked in an infinite battle known as the Blood War. Zariel was once a powerful angel, but her all-consuming focus to slay demons was her fall from grace. Archduchess of Avernus and the Lord of the First, Zariel was betrayed and imprisoned and used as a power source by a Devil general, before returning to her place. Her story is one of humiliation, pain, suffering, imprisonment, cruelty, and paranoia. The only relief is the destruction of her enemy, the blood of demons, and winning the war.
6. Rumors suspect Yugoloths intentionally help both sides of the Blood War just enough to maintain the conflict in status quo. Soul gems are used to pay for their services, a more potent and valuable version of the Soul Coins you find scattered across your adventure.
7. "My legions are the only thing standing between your precious Seven Heavens and the bottomless hunger of the Abyss. I did not fall into the clutches of evil. I rose to shoulder a cosmic burden." - Zariel.
8. Drow and Gith societies are predicated on avoiding signs of weakness at any turn. From birth, they are taught how to show just the right kind of subservience to their betters while bidding their time and plotting betrayals. Their life is spent perpetually looking over their shoulder, and cannot trust even their own mothers for safety. This cycle of cruelty is taught to the next generation as natural as breathing, eating, and sleeping.
9. The original "Hell Riders" were the mounted cavalry guard of Elturel. Faced with infernal threats, Zariel appeared and offered to lead a cavalry charge into the hells themselves. Faced with horror and death, many of the riders broke ranks, escaped, and closed the exit behind them, trapping Zariel and thousands of volunteers. Zariel swore revenge, but it was not until some ~60 years later that the betrayal of High Observer Thavius Kreeg resulted in the entire city being sucked into Avernus. The bitter memories of Elturelian tieflings stems from their memory of a time before they became enslaved tieflings, part of Zariel's cruel punishment for a betrayal that happened a generation before them, and the subsequent bigotry faced when they returned to the Prime Material.
10. Mystra is the reincarnation of Mystryl. As a consequence of Karsus's Folly, the damage to the Weave was so great that Mystryl sacrified herself. It was Mystra who, in repairing the weave, limited mortal access to magic to 9th level spells. She gives visions of the destruction of the Netherese to clerics and wizards who pray for her wisdom, and Karsus is memorialized as the enduring warning of what no mortal should ever attempt. Still, some - perhaps those you travel with - believe they could survive apotheosis.
11. Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm might sound, look, and act like a bumbling fool, but his disarming persona has allowed him to survive an audience with dragons, gods, and devils. His guide books are widely ridiculed by knowledgeable forces across Faerun as being full of embellishment, bluster, lies, speculation, and nonsense; but buried at the heart of everything is a grain of truth. In fact, people think he is such a harmless and dumb fool, that Mystra made him a Weave anchor - a pillar keeping the Weave intact should she ever die again - in the belief that if the secret got out, no one would believe it.
12. Elminster pretends that his job as Volo's editor is to prevent the spread of incorrect information. In reality, Volo sometimes - rarely - discovers something so powerful and dangerous that publishing it could threaten the very realms. Elminster subtly alters Volo's notes and intercepts manuscripts to obscure Volo's discoveries with injected nonsense.
