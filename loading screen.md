1. Kuo-Toa are a nascent psionic race. The power of their sheer collective belief is enough to manifest magic. It is believed that their own imagination birthed Blibdoolpoolp, a paranoid, reality-denying deity of the sea known for questionable sanity.
2. The animosty of Kobolds vs Gnomes is ancient. Some theorize that the two races naturally compete for similar habitats, and that is the source of their conflict; but kobolds harbor a deep grudge ever since their creator diety, Kurtulmak, was buried in a mountain as part of a "Prank." According to Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, kobolds enslaved gnomes and Garl Glittergold collapsed the mountain to free his people from kobold cruelty.
3. Across Faerun, there are a variety of classifications of "True Dragons" including Chromatic, Metallic, Ferrous, Planar, Gem, and Lung. There are also Air, Cobra, Deep, Fang, Force, Mist, Moon, Prismatic, Radiant, Rattelyr, Song, Sun, and Time dragons; and Brainstealers (horrible Illithid creations), Dzalmus, Vishaps, Hellfire wyrms, and the Abishai that serve Tiamat.
