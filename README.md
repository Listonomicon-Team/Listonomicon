# Welcome to Listonomicon
The goal of the “Listonomicon” is to be an out-of-the-box experience that enhances Baldurs Gate 3’s UI, quality of life, and replay value; introduces beloved aspects of the tabletop game’s past and present; and widens and deepens the game mechanics while respecting Larian’s vision for adapting DnD5e to an enjoyable cRPG. If you have questions, want to give feedback to the list curators, or run into trouble, please find ajax and LillyBird in [Boneyard Creations](https://discord.gg/UycnjCzKP8). If you face issues with the list, ask us first before bothering Wabbajack help or the creators of the many, many mods in Listonomicon.

# Releases (Newest to Oldest)  

# Release 0.9.3  
Save Safe?: ABSOLUTELY NOT
Updated 15 mods.
Updated mod settings to now properly apply CX level scaling for enemies, helping Listo achieve the advertised and intended difficulty curve!
Absolutely not save safe due to removing Aether's Obliterate. Trying to load a save that references now missing data (gear, equipment, spells, etc) will bork your game.

# Release 0.9.1 and 0.9.2  
Save Safe?: NO
Apologies for lack of notes but these version numbers were used for internal testing only.

# Release 0.9  
Save Safe?: NO

### This is the initial, beta release candidate for Listonomicon. 
It is not considered a final product, but it is ready for playtesting in a larger group than just the two authors. If you are interested in providing feedback and helping us on the road to 1.0, we believe Listo is already an envigorating experience! **The list currently has Aether's Obliterate enabled** as a dev testing speed tool as well as a final solution if you run into any hard progress errors (such as fights causing a game crash). We recommend you remove the two spells automatically added to your hotbar, or disable the mod in Mod Organizer if you cannot resist the temptation to cheat. Once a game starts with the mod enabled, however, it must be left enabled and you will just have to ignore the temptation of power.
